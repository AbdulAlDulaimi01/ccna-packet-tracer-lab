# CCNA Networking Lab ‚Äì VLANs, Inter-VLAN Routing, Static Routing, and ACLs  

This project demonstrates a small enterprise-style network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It includes multiple VLANs, Router-on-a-Stick inter-VLAN routing, static routing over a WAN link, switch trunking, and access control lists (ACLs) for traffic restriction.  

---

## üñß Topology Overview  

- 4 VLANs: HR (10), IT (20), Sales (30), Branch (40)  
- 2 Routers (Cisco 2911) with static WAN link  
- Multilayer switches (Cisco 3560) with trunk ports  
- 8 PCs (2 per VLAN)  
- Router-on-a-Stick configuration for inter-VLAN routing  
- ACL restricting traffic between VLAN 10 (HR) and VLAN 30 (Sales)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configurations Included  

- VLAN creation and port assignments  
- Trunk configuration between Cisco 3560 switches  
- Router-on-a-Stick inter-VLAN routing on Cisco 2911 routers  
- Static WAN routing between HQ (R1) and Branch (R2)  
- IP addressing and default gateways for PCs  
- **ACL restricting communication between HR (VLAN 10) and Sales (VLAN 30)**  

---

## üîí ACL Implementation  

An **Access Control List (ACL)** was configured on Router R1 to block HR (192.168.10.0/24) from communicating with Sales (192.168.30.0/24).  

---

‚úÖ Result:

HR ‚Üî Sales = Blocked

HR ‚Üî IT / Branch = Allowed

Sales ‚Üî IT / Branch = Allowed

---

Example configuration:  

R1(config)# access-list 100 deny ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# access-list 100 permit ip any any
R1(config)# interface g0/0.30
R1(config-if)# ip access-group 100 in
